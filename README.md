What is phishing? Well in simple terms, phishing is when you try to hack the human. The end goal is to get as much confidential information as possible. For example, usernames, passwords, bank account numbers and anything you wouldn't normally share with others. One common attack vector that we will talk about is email. 

 
There are 3 specific protocols that are involved in facilitating the outgoing and incoming messages. 
* POP3 - Used for recieving incoming emails (Port 110) (Secure Port 995)
* IMAP - Used for recieving incoming emails, but is newer and improves upon the older POP3 (Port 143) (Secure Port 993)
* SMTP - Provides the ability to send emails over the network (Port 25) (Secure Port 587 or 465)
